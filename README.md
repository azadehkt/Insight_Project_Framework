# Insight_Project_Framework

In This project the aim is to find COVID outcome predictor model based on patient information and viral sequences.
Random Forest could classify recovered versus deceased covid samples based on patient information features.
In the case where I use viral sequences as features, autoencoder is necessary for dimension reduction before classification.
